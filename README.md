# Description
This is to give a challenge for building your own neural network for data analysis.
You will find a python code which can be used to generate (x,y,z) sets of observables
for both signal and data (hypothetical signal and data, of course).  You will also find
a couple pre-generated samples of events (data\_bkg.txt, data\_sig.txt) that you can use
to understand the various features of signal and background.

There is also a sample of "mixed" data which contains an admixture of signal and 
background of unknown mixture fraction.  Once you design a classification technique, it
would be interesting to see if you can use it to classify this sample correctly.
