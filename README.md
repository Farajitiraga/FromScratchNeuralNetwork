# Description
This is to give a challenge for building your own discriminator and possibly neural network for data analysis. You will find a python code which can be used to generate sets of observables in 1D, 2D, and 3D for both signal and data (hypothetical signal and data, of course).  You will also find a couple pre-generated samples of events that you can use to understand the various features of signal and background. There is also a sample of "mixed" data for each simulation which can be used to test the effectiveness of your discriminator.

## v0 - 1 Dimensional
For a simple analysis
- Generating Script : `GenData_v0.py`
- Signal : `data_v0_sig.txt`
- Background : `data_v0_bkg.txt`
- Mixed : `data_v0_mixed.txt`

## v1 - 2 Dimensional (Simple)
For a simple analysis for a linear discriminant which should be close to optimal
- Generating Script : `GenData_v1.py`
- Signal : `data_v1_sig.txt`
- Background : `data_v1_bkg.txt`
- Mixed : `data_v1_mixed.txt`

## v2 - 2 Dimensional (Simple)
For a simple analysis for a first look at nonlinear discriminants
- Generating Script : `GenData_v2.py`
- Signal : `data_v2_sig.txt`
- Background : `data_v2_bkg.txt`
- Mixed : `data_v2_mixed.txt`

## v3 - 3 Dimensional
For a challenging non-linear multidimensional dataset
- Generating Script : `GenData_v3.py`
- Signal : `data_v3_sig.txt`
- Background : `data_v3_bkg.txt`
- Mixed : `data_v3_mixed.txt`
